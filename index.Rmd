# The Why

class: middle


# But first... Jargon Break!

# Bi or Poly-partite networks

> Networks that have nodes of multiple distinct types where connections can't form between nodes of the same type.

# The __S__tochastic __B__lock __M__odel?

A network model to cluster nodes into "blocks".

# Why SBMs

.pull-left[
- Working with Electronic Health Records (EHR) data

- Questions arise like "who are these people similar to and why?"

- Tried Deep Learning
  - Lack of interpretability
  - Needed specialization for bipartite networks

- Needed method that acknowledges the limitations of the data.

# A quick demo

## Simulate a network


.left-code[

Let's simulate a dense network with three blocks and 40 nodes per block.
```{r simulated-network, eval = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
library(sbmR)

k <- 3    
n_k <- 40 

network <- sim_basic_block_network(
  n_blocks = k,     
  n_nodes_per_block = n_k
)

visualize_network(network)
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r simulated-network-out, ref.label="simulated-network", echo=FALSE}
```
]


---

## Find optimal MCMC initialization


.left-code[
Next we find the optimal (closest to median of posterior) starting point for our MCMC
```{r collapse-network, eval = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
# Setup SBM from data
my_sbm <- create_sbm(network)

# Run agglomerative collapsing
collapse_results <- my_sbm %>%
  collapse_blocks(sigma = 1.01)

# Visualize method used to 
# choose best state from
# results
collapse_results %>% 
  visualize_collapse_results(
    heuristic = 'delta_ratio'
  ) +
  xlim(0,15) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = k)
```
]

.right-plot[

```{r collapse-network-out, ref.label="collapse-network", echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.dim = c(5,4)}
```

]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_sbm <- choose_best_collapse_state(my_sbm, collapse_results, heuristic = 'delta_ratio')
```

---

## Sanity check...

We can join the model's state after our collapse with the true generating data's blocks to see how well the collapsing algorithm fit the data. 
.left-code[

```{r check-collapse, eval = FALSE}
# Model state after merge
merged_state <- my_sbm %>% 
  get_state() %>% 
  select(id, parent)

# Join with true block info
left_join(
  network$nodes,
  merged_state,
  by = "id"
) %>% 
  rename(inferred = parent) %$% 
  table(inferred, block) 
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r check-collapse-out, ref.label="check-collapse", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Sampling from posterior


.left-code[

Run MCMC sweeps from collapse starting point to investigate the posterior structure.
```{r mcmc-sweeps, eval = FALSE}
sweep_results <- my_sbm %>% 
  mcmc_sweep(num_sweeps = 25, 
             eps = 0.25, 
             track_pairs = TRUE)

# Plot Sweep Results
sweep_results$sweep_info %>% 
  mutate(sweep = 1:n()) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    c(entropy_delta,
      num_nodes_moved)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sweep, 
             y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(name~., 
             scales = "free_y")
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r mcmc-sweeps-out, ref.label="mcmc-sweeps", echo = FALSE}
```

]

---

## Investigating Uncertainty in clustering

.left-code[

Plot the pairwise probability two nodes residing in the same block
```{r pairwise-propensity, eval = FALSE}

sweep_results$pairing_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = node_a, 
             y = node_b)) +
  geom_raster(
    aes(fill = proportion_connected)
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank()
  )
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r pairwise-propensity-out, ref.label="pairwise-propensity", echo = FALSE, fig.dims=c(4,4)}
```

]


---

## Concensus-SNE

.left-code[

Package function to visualize the pairwise node to node block similarity with a network. 
```{r pairwise-propensity-network, eval = FALSE}
sweep_results %>% 
  visualize_propensity_network()
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r pairwise-propensity-network-out, ref.label="pairwise-propensity-network", echo = FALSE}
```
