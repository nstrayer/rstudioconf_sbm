## What am I selling?

.pull-left[
### A Thing
An R package to perform uncertainty-aware unsupervised clustering of graph data. 
]
.pull-right[
### An Idea
That building an R package along with your research project serves to strengthen both the package and the research.

# Why SBMs

- Working with EHR data

- Questions like "who are these people similar to and why?" were asked

- Tried Deep Learning but lack of interpretability and specialization for poly-partite structure hurt it.

- We needed method that acknowledges the limitations of our data.

# Why write a package?


Graph-Tool in Python fits SBMs but...
- Lab uses R
- We're focused on uncertainty
- Wanted to tweak the underlying methods for partite networks etc.

# The Process

class: middle

# Getting started with the package

Looking into possible graph libraries
- iGraph is a monolith adding computationally inefficient steps in R brought it to a halt 
- [Jim Hester's talk about dependencies](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/it-depends-a-dialog-about-dependencies)
	
	
Deciding to use Rcpp
- Low level interface allowed stripping away of non-essentials for graph manipulation. 
- Wanted an excuse to write in a typed and compiled language.

# Tests and simulated data catch errors


.pull-left[
__Software $\to$ Unit Tests__

- Toy examples to test basic functions 
- Builds strong foundations

]

.pull-right[
__Statistics $\to$ Simulated Data__
- Stochastic data _will_ find your edge cases

# Getting speedy with it

- Initial results were... slow

_Runtime figure_

- Following the equations in their exact form is inefficient.

- Reworking equations by hand leads to better understanding

- Question the purpose of every operation, they are expensive

# Wrapping up package for public consumption

- Continuously writing vignettes/docs helps keep you focused on the big picture

- Once you're done, you already have written a lot

- Serves as an informal sniff-test for results

# The Product

---
class: middle


# What exactly is it?



- A native R package

- Fits SBMs

- Investigates the uncertainty of found structures by sampling from bayesian posterior

- Provides (a growing list of) visualizations to communicate results

# What is needed to use it?

- Data that can be represented as nodes and edges between those nodes. 
	- Patients with diagnoses
	- Genomes with mutations
	- Social relationships
	- ...
	
- Does not (yet) support non-discrete edges
	- Correlations between variables
	- Distances between cities
	- ...
	
- A desire to understand how stable your clusters are.

# Future plans

.pull-left[
Node-level uncertainty 
- Determine which values are structural outliers
]
	
.pull-right[
Lots of visualizations
- Visualization based inference for highly complex models
